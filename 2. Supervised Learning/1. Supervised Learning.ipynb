    "# Supervised Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "* Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n",

    "# Classification and Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Classificaion and Regression are two major types of Supervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification:- In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined\n",
    "list of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:- In previous tutorial, the prediction of flower using some specification in example of clssification(or multi-class Classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression:- In Regression, the goal is to predict a continuous number, or a floating-point number in programming terms (or real number in mathematical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:- Predicting a personâ€™s annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task.\n",

    "# Generalization, Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generalization:- \n",
    "If a model is able to make accurate predictions on\n",
    "unseen data, we say it is able to generalize from the training set to the test set. We want to build a model that is able to generalize as accurately as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overfitting:-\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when you fit a model too closely to the particularities of the training set and obtain a model that works well on the training set but is not able to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Underfitting:-\n",
    "Underfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low varience but high bias (to contrast the opposite overfitting from high varience and low bias).It is often a result of an excessively simple model."

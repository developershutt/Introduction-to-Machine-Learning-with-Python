# 3 Manifold Learning with t-SNE
 In this tutorial I applied t-SNE algorithm on digits dataset from scikit learn dataset and also do comparison between PCA and t-SNE.
 Here are some pictures that diffrentiate:-
 * Using PCA on digit dataset

 * And the result is pretty awesome........... Happy Coding


# 4 k-Means clustering

k-means clustering is one of the simplest and most commonly used clustering algorithms. It tries to find cluster centers that are representative of certain regions of the data. The algorithm alternates between two steps: assigning each data point to the closest cluster center, and then setting each cluster center as the mean of the data points that are assigned to it. The algorithm is finished when the assignment of instances to clusters no longer changes.

* In this tutorial some of the datasets are fitted with kmeans algorithm.
* Also the best and worst case of K-means in the code.

* K-Means performed well here in this example (in the code given)

* But somewhere k-means failed to separate the data points in the graph (in the code):

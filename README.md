# 2.Supervised Machine Learning
* Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

* Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
